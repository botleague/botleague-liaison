Most of botleague is open data, i.e. results, evaluations, artifacts,
logs, etc... This promotes transparency and trust in scores and also allows others
to much more easily contribute and extend botleague.

Some accounting data is secured, like eval_keys, to prevent cheating. Otherwise
use GitHub to manage user info.

Therefore, PLEASE THINK TWICE before adding new models here and use the public
storage mechanisms like GCS, S3, gist, Travis, YouTube, etc... instead if the data
can be made public.
